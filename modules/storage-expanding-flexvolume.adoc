= Expanding FlexVolume with a supported driver

[role="_abstract"]
When using FlexVolume to connect to your back-end storage system, you can expand persistent storage volumes after they have already been created. You do this by manually updating the persistent volume claim (PVC) in {product-title}.

Similar to other volume types, FlexVolume volumes can also be expanded when in use by a pod.

.Prerequisites

* The underlying volume driver supports resize. 
+
For information about which CSI drivers support resizing, see under the _Additional resources_ section "CSI drivers supported by {product-title}".

* The driver is set with the `RequiresFSResize` capability to `true`. The FlexVolume can then be expanded after restarting the pod.

* Dynamic provisioning is used.

* The controlling `StorageClass` object has `allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true`.
+
For more information, see section _Enabling volume expansion support_.

.Procedure

* To use resizing in the FlexVolume plugin, you must implement the `ExpandableVolumePlugin` interface using these methods:

** `RequiresFSResize`
+
If `true`, updates the capacity directly. If `false`, calls the `ExpandFS` method to finish the filesystem resize.

** `ExpandFS`
+
If `true`, calls `ExpandFS` to resize filesystem after physical volume expansion is done. The volume driver can also perform physical volume resize together with filesystem resize.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because {product-title} does not support installation of FlexVolume plugins on control plane nodes, it does not support control plane expansion of FlexVolume.

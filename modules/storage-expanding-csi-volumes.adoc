= Expanding CSI volumes

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to expand storage volumes after they have already been created.

Shrinking persistent volumes (PVs) is _not_ supported.

.Prerequisites

* The underlying CSI driver supports resize. 
+
For information about which CSI drivers support resizing, see under the _Additional resources_ section "CSI drivers supported by {product-title}".

* Dynamic provisioning is used.

* The controlling `StorageClass` object has `allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true`. 
+
For more information, see section _Enabling volume expansion support_.

.Procedure

* For the persistent volume claim (PVC), set `.spec.resources.requests.storage` to the desired new size.

.Verification
To confirm that the resize is finished, look at the `status.conditions` field of the PVC . {product-title} adds the `Resizing` condition to the PVC during expansion, which is removed after expansion completes.

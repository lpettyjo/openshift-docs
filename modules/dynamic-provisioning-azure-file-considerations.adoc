= Considerations when using Azure File

[role="_abstract"]
The default Azure File storage class does not support certain file system features.

The following features are not supported:

* Symlinks

* Hard links

* Extended attributes

* Sparse files

* Named pipes

Additionally, the owner user identifier (UID) of the Azure File mounted directory is different from the process UID of the container. You can specify the `uid` mount option in the `StorageClass` object to define a specific user identifier to use for the mounted directory.

The following `StorageClass` object demonstrates modifying the `uid` and group identifier (`gid`), along with enabling symlinks for the mounted directory.

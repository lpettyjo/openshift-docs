= Generic ephemeral volumes

[role="_abstract"]
Generic ephemeral volumes are a type of ephemeral volume that can be provided by all storage drivers that support persistent volumes and dynamic provisioning. Generic ephemeral volumes are similar to `emptyDir` volumes in that they provide a per-pod directory for scratch data, which is usually empty after provisioning.
